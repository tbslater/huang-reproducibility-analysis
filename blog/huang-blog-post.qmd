## INTRODUCTION

Reproducible research is critical. Publishing work that can be understood, replicated and developed by others is key to accelerating growth in any field. Yet, research as a whole is not reproducible. Reproducibility is of such great concern in some areas that many refer to it being in a crisis @RN7 and, in the interest of this article, modelling and simulation is certainly no exception to this [@RN4; @RN6].

Reproducibility is particularly important for healthcare simulation, given the potential consequences of the research. When taking the Hippocratic Oath, doctors promise to share their knowledge to advance healthcare, but there is no such mandate for health data scientists. Nonetheless, health data scientists ought to hold an individual responsibility to facilitate the sharing of their work. Researchers can, admittedly, be forgiven for lacking dedication to this cause; it takes time to invest in a paper's reproducibility. But I would strongly argue this is time well spent.

In an attempt to encourage reproducible research in health simulation, I am documenting my findings from a reproducibility analysis on a discrete-event simulation paper. I will introduce the model and discuss my attempts to reproduce the key results later in the article.

## THE MODEL

In the paper, discrete-event simulation is used to model endovascular clot retrieval (ECR) treatment allocation for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients. AIS patients are in direct competition for resources with elective non-stroke interventional neuroradiology (elective INR), emergency interventional radiology (emergency IR) and elective interventional radiology (elective IR) patients. The system diagram from Huang et al. 2019, given below, identifies the possible patient pathways.

Huang et al. were interested in how patient waiting times and resource usage varied under different scenarios:

1.  **Baseline:** standard procedure under the parameters given in Huang et al [@RN3].
2.  **Exclusive-use:** angio IR patients can only use the angio IR machine.
3.  **Double angio INRs:** two angio INRs and no angio IR machine.

Additionally, Huang et al. investigated the impact of adding an extra one and two hours to daytime shifts.

The paper's key results are given in five plots, all of which are shown below and I aimed to reproduce in the analysis.

## CODE

Huang et al. use the R package `simmer` to run simulations of their model. The package is designed for DES use and documentation can be found at <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simmer/index.html> [@RN9].

Code used by Huang et al. is freely available at <https://github.com/shiweih/desECR>.

It should be said that just by providing open code, the degree of reproducibility is enhanced. Huang et al. should be commended for doing this. In general, however, this is not enough; code shared must readable and usable. Fortunately, I largely found this to be the case for the code provided. Though additional comments may have been useful, reasonable knowledge of `simmer` and DES theory is sufficient for comprehension. The function used to run the simulation worked fine and was easily adaptable. A minor criticism is that, to me at least, the purpose fo the plotting function was unclear, as none of the plots were relevant to those in the paper.

## RESULTS

The DES model was simulated ten times for each scenario using the code provided. All simulations were run using a reproducibility seed set via `set.seed(14112024)`. Recreating the plots was attempted and my best efforts are described in this section.

**FIGURE 2**

My attempt to recreate figure 2 from the paper was for the most part unsuccessful. The closest plot I produced is not a match to the original, despite some similarities. The density shapes are inconsistent in most cases and specific values are out.

**FIGURE 3**

Reproduction of figure 3 was not achieved. Similar to figure 2, the densities are not consistent with the original plot. On top of this, the results I obtained for the baseline and double angio INR scenarios suggest a clear reduction in the waiting times when additional hours are added to the shift. This is a direct contradiction to a conclusion from the paper: only the exclusive-use scenario was found to see a significant drop in the wait times with one and two hours of extra work.

**FIGURE 4**

I was close to being able to reproduce figure 4. My resulting plot has a similar shape to the original figure and the general conclusions associated with it can be reached. However, the exact mean values for disability-free life are not quite consistent with those Huang et al. obtained. It is difficult to claim true reproducibility with this being the case.

**FIGURE 5**

Again, reproducing figure 5 was very nearly achieved, but not quite. I managed to obtain similar angio INR utilisation percentages when compared to the original. The value for the two angio INR scenario was in fact an exact match, but the other two were slightly out.

**SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE**

The methods required to reproduce the supplementary figure were largely similar to those used for figures 2 and 3 and so unsurprisingly reproduction was unsuccessful. I did manage to get somewhat consistent patterns to the paper - i.e. double and triple the number of patients follow a similar trend to the baseline number of patients - but the densities were not a match.

## CHALLENGES

**SEED FOR REPRODUCIBILITY**

As previously mentioned, I selected my own reproducibility seed for simulations. The code used by Huang et al. included elements of randomness, yet lacked a specified seed to account for this. As such, my simulations were always destined to be slightly different to the original ones.

**WAITING TIME PROBABILITIES**

Producing figures 2 and 3, as well as the supplementary figure, required the standardisation of mean waiting times. An explanation of how this was carried out was not included in the paper, requiring the derivation of my own method for doing this. In all likelihood, the method I used was not the same as the one in the paper.

For completeness, the approach I opted for can be summarised as follows:

1.  Assign all non-zero wait times into a set number of bins.
2.  Reassign all values as the midpoint of the bin they are collected in.
3.  Divide the frequency of values in each bin by the overall number of patients who did not wait at all, so that a ratio is obtained.
4.  Transform the ratios using the sigmoid function: $f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-r}}$, where $r$ is the ratio.

**MEAN DISABILITY-FREE LIFE DAYS ADDED**

It was clear from the paper that the output of figure 4 was just a function of the waiting times for ECR patients. What I was unsure about was which resources the waiting time applied to. Initially, I took the average of all resources used by an ECR patient, but this looked very wrong. I eventually settled on waiting times for just the angio INR resource.

## FINAL COMMENTS

It should be said that the intention of this article is not to criticise the work of Huang et al. It is merely meant to advocate for the need for reproducibility and to document my attempts to reproduce this particular piece of work. Huang et al. should be commended for their strong research: they have successfully constructed a fairly complex DES model and have achieved some substantial results. Nonetheless, it is my conclusion that their work is not able to be reproduced. Importantly, this is my conclusion. The results obtained are exclusively my attempts and it may be that others can in fact reproduce the figures successfully, but to the best of my ability I believe it cannot be done. So, despite a thorough piece of research, the paper is not easily verified. I would, however, argue that Huang et al. have provided us with something that can be manipulated and developed by others. Their code was very readable and ran well, it was just the specific plots that proved problematic.

Advocating for computationally reproducibility, I ought to make sufficient attempts to ensure the results in this article are themselves reproducible. In light of this, I have included my code (additional to that provided by Huang et al.) in a separate file.
